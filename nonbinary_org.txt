Alternating pronouns
he, her, his, herself (for example). Instead of using an alternative or neutral pronoun set, some people prefer an alternation between the binary-gendered sets. Justice Ginsburg is in favor of alternating "he" and "she" pronouns to make legal documents gender-inclusive.[3]

Use in fiction: In K. A. Cook's short story "Blue Paint, Chocolate and Other Similes," in Crooked Words, most of the story involves the narrator Ben moving from one set of pronouns to another for Chris as he tries to figure out Chris's gender. When the narrator is trying to determine whether Chris is male or female, Ben alternates between thinking of Chris as he or she. Upon recognizing that Chris identifies as nonbinary, the narrator begins using ze pronouns for Chris. Then, Ben finally finds a good moment to ask for Chris's pronoun preference.[6]

Nominative: When I tell her a joke he laughs.
Accusative: When I greet her I hug him.
Pronominal possessive: When he does not get a haircut, her hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If my mobile phone runs out of power, he lets me borrow hers.
Reflexive: Each child feeds herself. or Each child feeds himself.
Usage: In the Nonbinary Stats 2016 survey, 12% of respondents chose "mix it up; use different pronouns frequently and randomly" both alone and in addition to other pronoun choices.[7]


Che
che, chim, chis, chis, chimself. A set of gender-neutral pronouns listed in Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage under epicene pronouns.[8]

Co
co, co, co's (cos), co's, coself. Mary Orovan created these in 1970, derived from the Indo-European *ko.[9]</ref>[10]

E
There are several very similar sets of pronouns with the nominative form of "E," which have been independently proposed or revived over the last hundred years.[11][9] Sets of E pronouns listed in alphabetical order:


E, Em, Eir, Eirs, Emself. These are sometimes called spivak pronouns. In 1990, Michael Spivak used them in his manual, The Joy of TeX, so that no person in his examples had a specified gender. These pronouns became well-known on the Internet because they were built into a popular multi-user chat, LambdaMOO, in 1991. Many users enjoyed choosing pronouns that didn't specify their gender. The pronouns then became a common feature of other multi-user chats made throughout the 1990s. Although many other variations have been attributed to Michael Spivak, this is the actual set Spivak used in The Joy of TeX in 1990 or 1991. Note that he always capitalized all forms of it, but not all users of these pronouns do so. [12] Spivak doesn't indicate whether he created these pronouns, or adopted or adapted them from somewhere else. Spivak is credited with having created these pronouns, although his book doesn't outright say that they're of his own creation. (Compare Elverson's ey pronouns, which are very similar, with only a small spelling difference in the nominative form.)

Use in real life and non-fiction:

When a programmer added this pronoun set to LambdaMOO in 1991, he used the same spelling as Spivak, but not capitalized.[13] Regarding LambdaMOO, John Costello wrote, "I know the wizard who originally included the spivak pronouns on the MOO. He says he did it just on a whim after having read the Joy of TeX — he never thought they'd acquire the sexual and political nimbus they have over the years."[12] LambdaMOO's "help spivak" command explains that these pronouns "were developed by mathematician Michael Spivak for use in his books."[14] Programmer Roger "Rog" Crew tested the LambdaMOO system by putting more pronoun options into it in May, 1991, including Spivak's set he remembered from The Joy of TeX. Crew didn't delete the pronouns after testing them, and later expressed "dismay" that the spivak pronouns became popular.[15][16]
Spivak pronouns became such a part of 1990s Internet culture that a handbook to that culture, Yib's Guide to Mooing (2003), uses spivak pronouns whenever speaking of a hypothetical person whose gender need not be specified.[17]
In Internet environments, spivak was categorized not only as a set of pronouns, but as a gender identity, which Thomas describes: "The spivak gender [...] is more representative of an emotional and intellectual state than of a physical configuration. It should be pointed out at the start that the sexuality available to a spivak is a bonus of online life, but it isn't the raison d'etre. Rather, it's a subtle notion of a gender-free condition. It's not androgynous. It's not unisexual. It's simply ambiguous."[18] Some self-described spivaks use spivak as a proper noun for their non-binary gender identity.
Use in fiction:

Steven Shaviro's theoretical fiction novel Doom Patrols (1995-1997) uses spivak pronouns at times.[19]
The English translation of Sayuri Ueda's science fiction novel The Cage of Zeus (2011) uses spivak pronouns for genetically engineered characters with non-dyadic bodies and non-binary gender.[20]
Use for real non-binary people:

In 1996, 74 out of 7064 users on LambdaMOO went by spivak pronouns, making it the second most popular nonbinary pronoun there.[21] In 2002, 108 out of 4061 users on LambdaMOO used spivak pronouns, making it the most popular neologistic pronoun set there.[12]
In 1996, 10 out of 1015 users on MediaMOO went by spivak pronouns, making these the second most popular nonbinary pronoun.[22]
The author Bogi "prezzey" Takács goes by spivak pronouns.[23]
In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, 7% of participants were happy for people to use Spivak pronouns when referring to them.[7]

Ey (Elverson pronouns)
ey, em, eir, eirs, emself. (Compare the spivak pronoun E, which is very similar, with only a small spelling difference in the nominative form.) Called the Elverson pronouns, these were "created by Christine M. Elverson of Skokie, Illinois, to win a contest in 1975. (Black, Judie, ‘Ey has a word for it’, 1975-08-23.). Promoted as preferable to other major contenders (sie, zie and singular ‘they’) by John Williams's Gender-neutral Pronoun FAQ (2004)."[25]

Use in real life and non-fiction:

The Elverson pronouns were used by Eric Klein in the Laws of Oceania, 1993, to be gender-inclusive in a nonfictional micronation. Sometimes this pronoun set is mistakenly called "spivak pronouns," which differ only in the nominative form.
In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, 5 of around 3,000 participants were happy for people to use Elverson pronouns when referring to them - around 0.2%.[7]
Use in fiction:

CJ Carter's science fiction novel, Que Será Serees (2011) is about a species of people with a single gender, who are all called by Elverson's "ey" pronouns. Carter encourages other authors to use these gender-neutral pronouns.[26][27]

Fae
fae, faer, faer, faers, faerself. A fairy (faery, faerie, fey or Fair Folk) themed set created by Ciel (Tumblr user shadaras) in 2014 (or earlier?)[29] It may also have been independently coined earlier by someone else. This is the most commonly used nounself pronoun set, and it may have been created earlier than them. It may have been what inspired many people to create nounself pronouns in 2014. A similar fairy-themed set is fey, fey, feys, feys, feyself, which was recorded in 2014,[30] of unknown origin.

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke fae laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug faer.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, faer hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If my mobile phone runs out of power, fae lets me borrow faers.

Female pronouns
See She.


He
he, him, his, his, himself. Often called male pronouns, grammarians acknowledge that this standard set of pronouns can also be used as gender-neutral or gender-inclusive pronouns for unspecified persons, such as in instructions and legal documents. In the eighteenth century, when prescriptive grammarians decided that "singular they" was no longer acceptable as a gender-neutral pronoun, they instead recommended "gender-neutral he." "Prescriptive grammarians have been calling for 'he' as the gender-neutral pronoun of choice since at least 1745, when a British schoolmistress named Anne Fisher laid down the law in A New Grammar."[3] The use of "gender-neutral he" can make problems in how laws are interpreted, because it's unclear whether it is meant to be gender-inclusive or male-only. For example, in 1927, "the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that women were not persons because its statutes referred to 'persons' with male pronouns."[31][32] In the USA in the nineteenth century, suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton fought for laws to stop using the "gender-neutral he," because there were cases where this pronoun had been arbitrarily interpreted as a "male he" in order to exclude women from legal protections, or from the right to a license that they had passed exams for. This abuse of legal language happened even in if the documents explicitly said that "he" was meant to include women.[3] Thanks to work in the 1970s by feminists Casey Miller and Kate Swift, "gender-neutral he" has been significantly phased out of use, replaced by the more inclusive he or she.[33]

Use for real non-binary people: There are non-binary people who ask to be called by "he" pronouns, such as comedian Eddie Izzard, writer Richard O'Brien, songwriter Antony Hegarty, and guitarist Pete Townshend.

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke he laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug him.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, his hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow his.
Reflexive: Each child feeds himself.

Usage:

In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, 23% of participants were happy for people to use he pronouns when referring to them.[7]

It
it, it, its, its, itself. This standard English set of genderless pronouns is used for inanimate objects, animals, and human infants. During Dickens’ time, these were also acceptable pronouns for older human children and spirits of the dead, as these permutations of humanity were seen as not really male or female. This pronoun is not male or female. Using it for an adult human is often seen as an insult, dehumanizing. While considered offensive by most, some nonbinary people use "it" as a means of reclamation and to challenge the idea that genderlessness is inherently dehumanizing.

Because "it" pronouns are the default on LamdaMOO and on similar multi-user environments, they tend to be common there, but less common than "he" or "she." In 1996, "it" pronouns were the most popular non-binary pronoun choice on LambdaMOO (1162 out of 7065 player characters) and MediaMOO (280 out of 1015 player characters).[34]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke it laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug it.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, its hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow its.

Ne
Several sets of pronouns use "ne" in the nominative form. In alphabetical order:


ne, nem, nir, nirs, nemself. In Spectra, a science fiction comic by Cori Walters, characters with nonbinary genders are called by these pronouns. Walters uses this pronoun for one of the three gender roles in a species that has only one sex, and all people voluntarily choose their gender roles. The comic started in 2013 and is still in progress.[35]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke ne laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug nem.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, nir hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow nirs.
Reflexive: Each child feeds nemself.

ne, ner, nis, nis, nemself. In a 1974 issue of Today's Education, "Mildred Fenner attributes this to Fred Wilhelms."[9][11] Veterinarian Al Lippart independently proposed the same set of pronouns in 1999, recommending them for use when it would be inappropriate to specify the gender of a human, animal, or deity.[36]Lawyer Roberta Morris also independently proposed this same set of pronouns in 2009, saying that these pronouns would be more efficient for within the 140 character limit of Twitter than "he or she." Morris also pointed out that the "n" can refer to "neuter."[37]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke ne laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug ner.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, nis hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow nis.
Reflexive: Each child feeds nemself.

ne, nim, nis, ?, ?. Created around 1850,[11] and appeared in print in 1884.[9]

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke ne laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug nim.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, nis hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: ?
Reflexive: ?
Usage:

In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, ten different pronouns starting with ne were entered by 16 participants.[7]
No pronouns
Many people prefer not to be referred to by pronouns, and may feel dysphoria otherwise. Thirty-six percent of the lottelodge survey answered "Just my name" to the question "What are your preferred pronouns?". (Multiple answers were permitted.)

While the grammatical labels on the sample sentences below are no longer correct, the sentences can be adjusted to exclude pronouns while still talking about a specific person.

Nominative: (Demonstrative + noun replaces pronoun) When I tell someone a joke, that person laughs.
Accusative: (Eliminated second reference to the person) I greet my friend with a hug.
Pronominal possessive: (Replaced with an "it" that technically has no antecedent but clearly refers to the possessed thing) When someone does not get a haircut, it grows long.
Predicative possessive: (Possessive eliminated) If my mobile phone runs out of power, my friend lends me another.
Reflexive: (Reflexive emphasizing independence replaced with adverb) Each child gets food independently.
Using names or descriptions without changing the sentence structure:

Nominative: When I tell Taylor a joke Taylor laughs.
Accusative: When I greet Sylvia I hug Sylvia.
Pronominal possessive: When the kid does not get a haircut, the kid's hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow the friend's.
Reflexive: Larry feeds Larry.
Other noteworthy techniques for removing third-person pronouns from a sentence include

Passive voice: "Taylor's mopping the kitchen. When ? finishes, we'll go for a walk" becomes "Taylor's mopping the kitchen. When it's done, we'll go for a walk." Here "it" refers to the kitchen or maybe the task of mopping, and we use passive voice because there's no need to repeat who's doing it.
Second person: Instead of talking about someone in third person, why not talk to them instead? Say you're talking to Kevin and Elisa, who prefers no third-person pronouns, is in the room. You could tell Kevin, "I'd love to go with you for coffee, but Elisa's already claimed me for the evening," but if you do that and want to start expanding on what Elisa's up to, you might be tempted to use third-person pronouns. Instead you could shift to Elisa and say "but you've got me booked for the evening," and then Elisa could tell about the plans without being spoken for.
Usage:

In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, 11% of participants were happy for people to avoid using pronouns when referring to them, and a further 5 people specified that they want people to use their name as a pronoun.[7]

One
one, one, one’s, one’s, oneself. This is a standard English set of pronouns used for a hypothetical person whose gender is not specified.

Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug one.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, one's hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow one's.

Ou
ou, ou, ous, ous, ouself. A set of singular gender-neutral pronouns that were first recorded in a native English dialect the sixteenth century. "In 1789, William H. Marshall records the existence of a dialectal English epicene pronoun, singular ou: '"Ou will" expresses either he will, she will, or it will.' Marshall traces ou to Middle English epicene a, used by the fourteenth-century English writer John of Trevisa, and both the OED and Wright's English Dialect Dictionary confirm the use of a for he, she, it, they, and even I."

Use in fiction: In K. A. Cook's short story "The Differently Animated and Queer Society," the character Moon asks to be called by "ou" pronouns.[38]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke ou laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug ou.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, ous hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow ous.
Reflexive: Each child feeds ouself.

Per
per (person), per, per, pers, perself. Called "person pronouns," these are meant to be used for a person of any gender. Compare Phelps's phe pronouns, which are also based on the word "person." John Clark created "per" pronouns in a 1972 issue of the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association.[9]

Use in real life and non-fiction: Person pronouns were one of the sets of pronouns built in to MediaMOO for users to choose from.[39] Richard Ekins and Dave King used these pronouns in the book The Transgender Phenomenon (2006).[40]

Use in fiction: In Marge Piercy's feminist novel, Woman on the Edge of Time, 1976, Piercy used "per" pronouns for all citizens of a utopian future in which gender was no longer seen as a big difference between people.[12]

Racial pronouns
In Douglas Hofstadter's short satirical essay, "A Person Paper on Purity in Language," the fictional William Satire describes a world in which racism is so pervasive that even pronouns have long been based around race instead of gender. In Person Paper, William Satire criticizes an equally fictional activist (apparently modeled after the non-fictional Casey Miller) who had taken an objection "to the age-old differentiation of whites from blacks by the third-person pronouns 'whe' and 'ble.' Ble promotes an absurd notion: that what we really need in English is a single pronoun covering both races. Numerous suggestions have been made, such as 'pe,' 'tey,' and others, These are all repugnant to the nature of the English language, as the average white in the street will testify, even if whe has no linguistic training whatsoever."[41] In the essay's hypothesized world, where racism is even more deeply embedded in language than it is in the real world, non-racist language and race-neutral pronouns are seen as controversial changes. Hofstadter uses this imagined scenario to make it visible to us how much sexism is in our language. It demonstrates how the pervasiveness of discriminatory language is taken for granted and used to undermine oppressed peoples. The essay is effective in its intention to show how pervasive sexism is in real life. However, despite the essay's best efforts, it still downplays how racism actually does pervade language and daily life, and therefore makes racism look as if it was a smaller problem than sexism. This flaw is an example of a ethnicity and culture#false comparison, where making a comparison between racism and sexism means overlooking important differences between them.

These pronouns were never meant to be used. Don't use them. In real life, nobody has proposed racial pronouns in earnest.


She
she, her, her, hers, herself. Often called female pronouns, although in standard usage, they're not used exclusively for women. Grammarians agree that it is standard and acceptable for this set to be used for women, female animals, and ships. The set is also poetically used for countries and fields of studies, which grammarians also see as acceptable. Some feminists recommend replacing "gender-neutral he" with "gender-neutral she." "In 1970, Dana Densmore’s article “Speech is the Form of Thought” appeared in No More Fun and Games: A Journal of Female Liberation; Densmore is evidently the first U.S. advocate of 'she' as a gender-neutral pronoun, a solution many writers, particularly academic writers, favor today."[3] 1974, Gena Corea recommended replacing the "gender-neutral he" with a "gender-neutral she," and like Denmore, argued that the word "she" would be understood to include the word "he."[9]

Use as a gender-neutral pronoun in fiction:

Anne Leckie's science fiction novels Ancillary Justice (2013) and Ancillary Sword (2014) were set in a futuristic society that is indifferent to gender, so all the characters are called by gender-neutral "she" pronouns, leaving their actual gender and sex undisclosed. Leckie says she had an assumption at the time that gender is binary, so these are likely not non-binary characters.[42]
Cartoonist Rebecca Sugar explained that in her animated science fiction series, Steven Universe, the alien people called Gems really have no sex or gender, even though they all look like women. For this reason, the Gems are only arbitrarily called by "she" pronouns. Sugar said, "Technically, there are no female Gems! There are only Gems! [...] Why not look like human females? That's just what Gems happen to look like! [...] There's a 50 50 chance to use some pronoun on Earth, so why not feminine ones-- it's as convenient as it is arbitrary!"[43] This is a gender-neutral use of "she" pronouns.

Use for real non-binary people: There are non-binary gender people who ask people to use "she" pronouns for them, such as actor Rain Dove, singer-songwriter Ellie Jackson, musician JD Samson, singer Kieran Strange, and actor Tilda Swinton.

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke she laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug her.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, her hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow hers.

Singular They
See They.


Spivak
See E.


They
they, them, their, theirs, themself (or theirself, theirselves, or themselves). These are standard English pronouns for speaking of groups. Grammarians question and debate the validity of also using this set as "singular they," a gender-neutral pronoun for an individual whose gender isn't specified, because they feel unsatisfied by how it still works grammatically like a plural. (Similar to how we say "you are," even when referring to a singular "you.") However, "singular they" has been common usage in English for over a thousand years, as attested by many written documents. It was used so by Shakespeare, Jane Austen, the Oxford English Dictionary, Louis Carroll, C. S. Lewis, and others. Grammaticians only recently decided that it was ungrammatical to use in the singular, because it is still used with verbs as though it was a plural.[44] Though the grammar may be questionable, it is still standard use today.

Singular "they" gets a surprising number of complaints, considering people use it all the time for people whose gender is unknown. ("So, your doctor, what have they prescribed?" etc.) However, there are a lot of arguments that it's correct. This article on Motivated Grammar goes through a few reasons, including the fact that it's consistently been in use since Chaucer's time, around 1400.

A most comprehensive article about the history of singular "they" is Henry Churchyard's web-page, Singular 'Their' in Jane Austen and Elsewhere.

Most people are familiar with how singular "they" works, as plenty of people use it all the time without really thinking about it.

There are several versions of the reflexive form of this pronoun: "themself," "theirself," "theirselves," and "themselves." The Oxford Dictionary says that "themself" has been used since the 14th century for a person of unknown sex.[45] Dictionary.com says that "theirself" has also been used for this since about 1300.[46] The Free Dictionary adds that "theirself" and "theirselves" are more common in southern and midland US English.[47] Because both of these are for talking about a single person, they're both considered non-standard or informal usage, despite the hundreds of years of common usage. The plural form of "themselves" is supposed to be more formal, but can sound strange when used for a single person, because they are not several "selves," but one "self". This is another part of the plural/singular "they" problem. People differ about which version of the reflexive form they prefer. If someone asks to be called by "they" pronouns, it might be a good idea to ask which form of the reflexive form they prefer.

Use as a singular in fiction:

In a short sci-fi story by Benjanun Sriduangkaew, "Silent Bridge, Pale Cascade" (2013), one of the characters is described as a "neutrois," and called by "they" pronouns.[48][49]
In Kameron Hurley's fantasy novel, Empire Ascendant, all people in a consent culture get to choose which of the five gender roles they identify with. Hurley calls characters who are "ungendered" by singular they pronouns.[50]
In K. A. Cook's anthology Crooked Words, the character Chris asks to be called by "they" pronouns. Chris is in the short stories "Blue Paint, Chocolate and Other Similes" and "Everything In A Name."[51]
Use for real non-binary people: Some nonbinary people ask to be called by "singular they" pronouns, including writer Ivan E. Coyote, actor Tom Phelan, actor Jiz Lee, singer-songwriter Rae Spoon, and rapper Raeen Roes. Deborah Rogers mentions having a trans male student who asked to be called by "they" pronouns.[52]

thon, thon, thons, thon's, thonself. Charles Crozat Converse of Erie, Pennsylvania proposed this pronoun in 1858, based on a contraction of "that one."[53] (The Gender-Neutral Pronoun FAQ gives this pronoun's date as 1884 instead.)[11] The "thon" pronoun was included in Webster's International Dictionary (1910). "Thon" was used throughout the writings by the founders of chiropractic, B.J. and D.D. Palmer, in 1910, and is therefore familiar to chiropractors.[54]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke thon laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug thon.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, thons hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow thon's.
Reflexive: Each child feeds thonself.
Usage:

In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, one person out of over 3,000 said that they were happy for people to use thon to refer to thon.[7]

Ve
There are several sets of pronouns that use "ve" in the nominative form, the earliest of which was created in 1970. Listed in alphabetical order:


ve, ver, vis, vis, verself. A set of pronouns used-- but not created-- by Greg Egan for non-binary gender characters-- including artificial intelligences, as well as transgender humans who identify as a specific nonbinary gender they call "asex"-- in his novels Distress (1995) and Diaspora (1998).[55] In Alastair Reynolds's science fiction novel On the Steel Breeze, one character is called by these ve pronouns. The novel never gives any exposition about this character's sex, gender, or pronouns, and ver gender-neutrality doesn't influence the plot. The lack of remark gives the impression that a nonbinary gender is unremarkable, but this is also why some readers thought the pronouns were a misprint.[56] In Keri Hulme's mystery novel The Bone People (1984), a character is called by these ve pronouns.[57]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke ve laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug ver.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, vis hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow virs.
Reflexive: Each child feeds verself.

Xe
There are several similar sets of neologistic gender-neutral pronouns that use "xe," "ze," "zhe," or "zie" in nominative form. Regardless of spelling, their nominative form is pronounced "zee," and was based on the pronoun sie. The earliest documented version was created in 1972.[9] In alphabetical order, versions of this pronoun set include:


xe, hir, hir, hirs, hirself. Compare the similar "ze, hir..." set, which is apparently used in more literature and by more people. The "xe" version was "Used on alt.support.intergendered and alt.support.crossdressing," transgender communities on the Internet in the 1990s.[58]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke xe laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug hir.

Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow hirs.

xe, xyr (xem), xyr, xyrs, xyrself (xemself). This pronoun set appears in 1993 in a conversation in an autism mailing list on the Internet.[60][61] The "xem" version of this pronoun set appears in a printed discussion from the mailing list of Autism Network International in 2000, with the explanation that it "was originally used to refer to an intersexed person, but is also used to refer to a person of any gender."[62] This pronoun set was recommended in 2005 by Jonathan de Boyne Pollard, with the version that includes "xem," and both "xyrself" and "xemself."[63]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke xe laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug xem. (Or hug xyr.)
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, xyr hair grows long.

Yo
yo, (N/A), (N/A), (N/A), (N/A) In addition to an interjection and greeting, "yo" is a gender-neutral pronoun in a dialect of African-American Vernacular English spoken by middle school students in Baltimore, Maryland, the student body of which is 97% African-American. These students had spontaneously created the pronoun as early as 2004, and commonly used it. A study by Stotko and Troyer in 2007 examined this pronoun. The speakers used "yo" only for same-age peers, not adults or authorities. They thought of it as a slang word that was informal, but they also thought if it as just as acceptable as "he" or "she". "Yo" was used for people whose gender was unknown, as well as for specific people whose gender was known, often while using a pointing gesture at the person in question. The researchers collected examples of the word in use, such as "yo threw a thumbtack at me," "you acting like I said what yo said," and "she ain't really go with yo." The researchers only collected examples of "yo" used in the nominative form. That is, they found no possessive forms such as "yo's," and no reflexive forms such as "yoself." As such, "yo" pronouns might be used only in nominative form, similar to another native English gender-neutral pronoun, "a." Either that, or these forms exist, and the researchers just didn't collect them.[64][65]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke yo laughs.
Accusative: (N/A?)
Pronominal possessive: (N/A?)
Predicative possessive: (N/A?)
Reflexive: (N/A?)

Ze
There are several similar sets of neologistic gender-neutral pronouns that use "xe," "ze," "zhe," or "zie" in nominative form. Regardless of spelling, their nominative form is pronounced "zee," and was based on the pronoun sie. The earliest documented version was created in 1972.[9] In alphabetical order, versions of this pronoun set include:


ze, hir, hir, hirs, hirself. Compare the similar "xe, hir..." set, which is the version less attested by print sources. Sarah Dopp wrote a blog post about the "ze" version in 2006.[66] Leslie Feinberg also used the "ze" version in the book Drag King Dreams (2006),[67] Erika Lopez used the "ze" version in The Girl Must Die: A Monster Girl Memoir (2010).[68] M. J. Locke used the "ze" version in the book Up Against It (2011).[69]

Use in real life and non-fiction: Kate Bornstein used them in the books Nearly Roadkill (1996) (with Caitlin Sullivan June)[70], and My Gender Workbook (1998) in reference to hirself, and to other specific transgender people, as well as hypothetical persons of unspecified gender.[71]

Use in fiction:

Kameron Hurley used these pronouns in the fantasy novels The Mirror Empire and Empire Ascendant, for characters who are ataisa, an in-between gender role where their culture puts everyone who has a nonbinary gender.[72]
In Seth Dickinson's short science fiction story, "Sekhmet Hunts the Dying Gnosis: A Computation" (2014), a transhuman character of "uncertain ... sex" is called by the pronoun "ze," which only appears in the nominative form.[73]
In K. A. Cook's short story "Blue Paint, Chocolate and Other Similes," in Crooked Words, when the narrator Ben recognizes that Chris identifies as nonbinary, Ben begins using "ze, hir" pronouns for Chris, before finding a good moment to ask for Chris's actual pronoun preference.[74] In another story by K. A. Cook, "The Differently Animated and Queer Society," the character Pat goes by "ze, hir" pronouns, and uses them for other characters before finding out each of their own pronoun preferences.[75]
The Len'en Wiki, an English wiki about a Japanese video game series, uses these pronouns as standard because nearly all the characters in the game series do not have a known gender.
Use for real non-binary people: Kate Bornstein goes by these "ze, hir" pronouns. Leslie Feinberg asked to be called by "ze, hir" pronouns, along with "zie, hir" and "she."[76] In a magazine interview from 2014, Gabriel Antonio and another anonymous person both asked to be called by these pronouns.[77]

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke ze laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug hir.
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, hir hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow hirs.
Reflexive: Each child feeds hirself.
Usage:

In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, 9% of people said they'd be happy for people to use "zie/hir/hir/hirs/hirself, or some variation thereof" to refer to them.[7]

Zie
zie, zir (zim), zir, zirs, zirself. (Compare the most similar pronoun set, "ze, zir", and other similar pronouns, "xe" and "zhe".) The Gender Neutral Pronoun FAQ says this set (with the "zie" spelling, and accusative "zir") was widely used on the Internet at the time, but doesn't know when it was created.[78] Andrés Pérez-Bergquist recommended this set (with the "zie" spelling, and accusative "zim") in 2000, but claims not to have created it.[79]This set (with the "zie" spelling, and accusative "zir") is in the fantasy setting of Bard Bloom's World Tree, for the many characters with sexes other than female or male. Many species in this setting have such sexes, including the protagonist of a book in that setting, Sythyry's Journal, which was first serialized as a blog starting in 2002. The setting also has a role-playing game handbook, World Tree: A role playing game of species and civilization (2001).

Forms:

Nominative: When I tell someone a joke zie laughs.
Accusative: When I greet a friend I hug zir. (Or hug zim.)
Pronominal possessive: When someone does not get a haircut, zir hair grows long.
Predicative possessive: If I need a phone, my friend lets me borrow zirs.
Reflexive: Each child feeds zirself.
Usage:

In the 2016 Nonbinary Stats survey, 8 people (around 0.3%) said they'd be happy for people to use zie/zir (or some similar spelling) to refer to them.[7]
